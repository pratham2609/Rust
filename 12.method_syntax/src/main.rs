// The &self is actually short for self: &Self. Within an impl block, the type Self is an alias for the type that the impl block is for. 
// Methods must have a parameter named self of type Self for their first parameter, 
// so Rust lets you abbreviate this with only the name self in the first parameter spot. 
// Note that we still need to use the & in front of the self shorthand to indicate that this method borrows the Self instance, 
// just as we did in rectangle: &Rectangle. Methods can take ownership of self, borrow self immutably, as weâ€™ve done here,
// or borrow self mutably, just as they can any other parameter.
